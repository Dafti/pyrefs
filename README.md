# Introduction

`pyrefs` provides a series of libraries helpful to parse and analyze Resilient
FileSystems (ReFS).
An interactive application to analyze a ReFS dump named `Igor` is also
provided.

`pyrefs` is still very immature, as of today it has been only tested with
partitions using ReFS version 1.1.
The code is neither far from perfect, and it would need a good refactoring.
We are working on that, but be aware when you retrieve `pyrefs`.

Finally, `pyrefs` naming convention for ReFS structures is mainly guided by
Henry Georges thesis work.
You can find Henry Georges's thesis and the code he developed to analyze ReFS
here <https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/2502565>.

## Thanks

We would like to thank: Henry Georges, his thesis document has been the
foundation of this project; Willi Ballenthin, for the ReFS dump images on his
website and his ReFS articles; and all the other authors providing information
on the ReFS filesystem.

We would like to also thank Juan Romero, Olivier Gilles, Isabelle Isabelle
Moukala-Mouberi and Claudia Duhoo, who performed a similar work than ours.
Your feedback was unvaluable.

# Dependencies

`pyrefs` was developed using Python 3 (Python 3.6.6) at the time of this
release, and has been tested to work on Windows and Linux platforms.

No special dependencies, if you find any please let us know.

# Igor

An interactive command line tool is provided to facilitate the analysis of
those not willing to play with the code.
We call it `Igor` and it can be launched with Python.

`Igor` provides a limited toolset to analyze ReFS partitions exploiting the
`pyrefs` library, the following sections enumerate them.

## Examples

Some examples of Igor usage are provided in the `examples` folder as Igor
records.
To execute/playback the examples contained in the `examples` folder download
the `Windows8ReFSImages.zip` file provided by Willi Ballenthin at
<http://www.williballenthin.com/forensics/refs/test_images/>, copy it to the
`examples/dump` folder and uncompress it.
Then you can use igor to test the records in the examples folder with the
command `playback examples/<example_file>`.

## Command reference

### file

Usage: `file [-h] [-i] [-f] [-F] dump`

Load the provided dump file for analysis, and automatically select the ReFS
partition for you.
You can also initialize the list of entryblocks of the partition.

Positional arguments:

 - `dump`: File to use as dump for the analysis.

Optional arguments:

 - `-h`, `--help`: show this help message and exit
 - `-i`, `--initiliaze-entryblocks`: find blocks in provided dump
 - `-f`, `--files`: find files in provided dump (only considered if -i defined)
 - `-F`, `--folders`: find folders in provided dump (only considered if -i
   defined)

### vol

Usage: `vol [-h]`

Dump the volume record information from the current ReFS partition.

Optional arguments:

 - `-h`, `--help`: show this help message and exit

Dump the volume record information from the current ReFS partition.

### part

Usage: `part [-h] [partidx]`

Show available partitions in the currently loaded dump if no parameter is
given, switch to the provided partition if any provided.

Positional arguments:

 - `partidx`: Partition index of the partition to use for analysis

Optional arguments:

 - `-h`, `--help`: show this help message and exit

### find\_entryblocks

Usage: `find_entryblocks [-h] [-f] [-F]`

Find and show all the entryblocks in current partition. If requested number of
files and folders information will be also collected.

Optional arguments:

 - `-h`, `--help`: show this help message and exit
 - `-f`, `--files`: Collect information on the number of files in the
   entryblocks.
 - `-F`, `--folders`: Collect information on the number of folders in the
   entryblocks.

### find\_pattern

Usage: `find_pattern [-h] pattern`

Find a data pattern in all the blocks of the current partition. Special
characters (including spaces, carriage return, etc.) are not allowed in the
pattern, think of escaping them.

Positional arguments:

 - `pattern`: Pattern to find in the current partition blocks.

Optional arguments:

 - `-h`, `--help`: show this help message and exit

### list\_filenames

Usage: `list_filenames [-h]`

List the found filenames from the list of entryblocks with filenames.

Optional arguments:

 - `-h`, `--help`: show this help message and exit

### list\_folders

Usage: `list_folders [-h]`

List the found filename folders from the list of entryblocks with folders.

Optional arguments:

 - `-h`, `--help`: show this help message and exit
